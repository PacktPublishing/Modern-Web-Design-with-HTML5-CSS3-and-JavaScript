Brackets works directly with your browser to push code edits instantly, so your browser preview is always up to date while you're coding — no page reloads needed. In order to keep your current web browsing unaffected, Brackets Live Preview opens an additional copy of Chrome using a separate Chrome profile.

There are two different ways to use Live Preview:

With no backend (i.e. server-side) logic — Open an HTML file and select File > Live Preview (or click the "lightning bolt" icon). Brackets will launch Chrome and open your file in a new tab. The content is served statically from a built-in server that Brackets runs — it doesn't contain any of your app's backend logic.

This mode offers the full range of Live Preview functionality:

Browser preview updates in real time as you type in HTML and CSS files (without reloading)

File extensions recognized for HTML files are: htm, html, and xhtml.

If you edit any other type of file, the page is auto-reloaded when you save

When you move the cursor around an HTML file, the corresponding element is highlighted in the browser

When you move the cursor around a CSS/LESS/SCSS file, all elements matching the current rule are highlighted in the browser

(All cursor-driven highlighting can be disabled by unchecking View > Live Preview Highlight)
