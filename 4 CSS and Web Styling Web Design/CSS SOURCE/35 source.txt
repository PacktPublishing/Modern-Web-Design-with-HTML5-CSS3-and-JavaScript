There are several rules ( applied in this order ) :

inline css ( html style attribute ) overrides css rules in style tag and css file

a more specific selector takes precedence over a less specific one

rules that appear later in the code override earlier rules if both have the same specificity.

A css rule with !important always takes precedence.
